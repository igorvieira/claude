# Maverick - Autonomous Development

Execute complete development cycle for: **$ARGUMENTS.tickets**

## Mode Detection

Parse input to determine mode:
- **Linear ticket**: `AP-552` → Fetch from Linear, standard execution
- **Multiple Linear tickets**: `AP-552,AP-553,AP-554` → Parallel execution with worktrees
- **Local mode**: `--local "task description"` → No Linear, work from provided description
- **Local multi**: `--local "task1" "task2" "task3"` → Multiple local tasks, sequential execution

---

## Local Mode (`--local`)

When `--local` is detected, skip Linear entirely. The user provides the task description directly.

### Single Local Task

```
/maverick --local "Add dark mode toggle to the settings page"
```

### Multiple Local Tasks

```
/maverick --local "Fix login form validation" "Add loading spinner to submit button" "Refactor auth hook"
```

### Local Workflow

```
DESCRIBE → ARCHITECT → BRANCH → IMPLEMENT → QA → DELIVER
```

### Phase 1: Parse Task Description

Extract from the provided text:
- **Goal**: What needs to be done
- **Scope**: Which parts of the codebase are affected
- **Task type**: FRONTEND, BACKEND, or FULLSTACK (infer from description)
- **Acceptance criteria**: Derive from the goal

If the description is vague, use the codebase to infer context:
- Search for related files and patterns
- Identify the area of the codebase affected
- Build a clear task definition from the description + code context

### Phase 2: Architecture (senior-architect)

Same as Linear mode - analyze and plan:
- Files to create/modify
- Components/services needed
- Implementation steps

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Phase 3: Create Branch

```bash
# Generate branch name from task description
# e.g., "Add dark mode toggle" → feature/add-dark-mode-toggle
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/<slugified-description>
```

### Phase 4-6: Implement → QA → Deliver

Same as Linear mode (see below).

### Local Completion

```
MAVERICK_COMPLETE

Task: <task description summary>
Branch: feature/<branch-name>
Summary: <bullets>
Status: Ready for PR
```

### Multiple Local Tasks

For multiple `--local` tasks, execute **sequentially** (each on its own branch):

```
Task 1: feature/fix-login-validation → DONE
Task 2: feature/add-loading-spinner → DONE
Task 3: feature/refactor-auth-hook → DONE
```

Output at the end:

```
MAVERICK_LOCAL_COMPLETE

Completed Tasks:
- "Fix login form validation" → feature/fix-login-validation
- "Add loading spinner" → feature/add-loading-spinner
- "Refactor auth hook" → feature/refactor-auth-hook

All branches pushed and ready for PR.
```

---

## Linear Mode (Single Ticket)

For one ticket, execute standard workflow:

```
/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "/maverick $ARGUMENTS.tickets" --max-iterations 30 --completion-promise "MAVERICK_COMPLETE"
```

---

## Linear Mode (Multiple Tickets - Parallel with Worktrees)

When multiple tickets are provided (comma-separated), execute in parallel using git worktrees.

### Step 1: Parse Tickets

```bash
# Split tickets into array
TICKETS=($ARGUMENTS.tickets)  # e.g., AP-552,AP-553,AP-554
```

### Step 2: Determine Repository

Identify the target repository based on task types:
- **Frontend tasks**: `<project-root>/<frontend-app>`
- **Backend tasks**: `<project-root>/svc-<service-name>`

### Step 3: Setup Worktrees

For each ticket, create a worktree:

```bash
# Base repository
REPO_BASE="<project-root>/<repo>"
WORKTREE_BASE="<project-root>/worktrees"

# Create worktree directory
mkdir -p $WORKTREE_BASE

# For each ticket
for TICKET in ${TICKETS[@]}; do
  BRANCH="feature/$(echo $TICKET | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
  WORKTREE_PATH="$WORKTREE_BASE/$TICKET"

  # Create worktree with new branch
  git -C $REPO_BASE worktree add $WORKTREE_PATH -b $BRANCH

  echo "Created worktree: $WORKTREE_PATH on branch $BRANCH"
done
```

### Step 4: Launch Parallel Ralph Loops

Each ticket runs in its own worktree with independent Ralph loop:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Ticket 1
cd $WORKTREE_BASE/AP-552
/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "/maverick-single AP-552" --max-iterations 30 --completion-promise "MAVERICK_COMPLETE"

# Terminal 2 - Ticket 2
cd $WORKTREE_BASE/AP-553
/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "/maverick-single AP-553" --max-iterations 30 --completion-promise "MAVERICK_COMPLETE"

# Terminal 3 - Ticket 3
cd $WORKTREE_BASE/AP-554
/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "/maverick-single AP-554" --max-iterations 30 --completion-promise "MAVERICK_COMPLETE"
```

### Step 5: Cleanup Worktrees (after completion)

```bash
for TICKET in ${TICKETS[@]}; do
  git -C $REPO_BASE worktree remove $WORKTREE_BASE/$TICKET
done
```

---

## Shared Workflow (Linear & Local)

```
[TASK SOURCE] → ARCHITECT → BRANCH → IMPLEMENT → QA → DELIVER
```

### Phase 1: Fetch Task

**Linear mode:**
```
mcp__linear__get_issue with id: "<ticket>"
```

**Local mode:**
Parse the provided task description directly.

Identify:
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Figma links (if any)
- Task type: **FRONTEND** or **BACKEND**

### Phase 2: Architecture (senior-architect)

Analyze and plan:
- Files to create/modify
- Components/services needed
- Implementation steps

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Phase 3: Create Branch (or use worktree branch)

**Linear mode:**
```bash
# Use branch name from Linear if available
git checkout -b <linear-suggested-branch-name>
```

**Local mode:**
```bash
# Generate from task description
git checkout -b feature/<slugified-description>
```

### Phase 4: Implement

**FRONTEND** (senior-frontend):
- Get Figma context if available
- Use the project's design system components
- Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit`

**BACKEND** (senior-backend):
- Implement commands/queries
- Write tests
- Verify: `go build ./... && go test ./...`

### Phase 5: QA Review (senior-qa)

**FRONTEND checks:**
- [ ] Figma tokens matched
- [ ] Design system components used
- [ ] TypeScript passes
- [ ] All criteria met

**BACKEND checks:**
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Migrations work
- [ ] Error handling correct
- [ ] Events published

### Phase 6: Deliver (Commit, Push, Open PR)

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(<ticket-or-scope>): <description>"
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Then create the PR and **capture the PR number** from the output:

```bash
PR_URL=$(gh pr create --title "..." --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>

## Test plan
- [ ] <step 1>
EOF
)")
PR_NUMBER=$(echo "$PR_URL" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
```

Record both `$PR_URL` and `$PR_NUMBER` — they are required inputs for Phase 7.

### Phase 7: PR Review Wait + Resolver Hand-off

This phase is **mandatory** after every `gh pr create`. The goal is to give human + automated reviewers a 10-minute window to leave feedback, then either escalate to `/review-resolver` or declare the PR clean.

1. **Schedule the check 10 minutes out** using `ScheduleWakeup` (do not block-wait — the run yields and re-enters when the timer fires):
   ```
   ScheduleWakeup({
     delaySeconds: 600,
     reason: "10-min review window for PR <PR_NUMBER>",
     prompt: "/maverick:resume-review <PR_NUMBER>"   # or inline the resume steps below
   })
   ```
   If `ScheduleWakeup` is unavailable in the current harness, fall back to `/loop 10m` once with the same payload.

2. **When the timer fires, gather PR feedback**:
   ```bash
   gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json state,reviews,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup
   gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments --paginate
   gh api repos/:owner/:repo/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments --paginate
   ```
   Treat **all three** sources as inputs — inline-thread comments, top-level PR comments, and formal reviews all carry actionable items.

3. **Decide the next step** by classifying the gathered feedback:
   - `reviewDecision == "CHANGES_REQUESTED"` **OR** any unresolved review thread **OR** any comment requesting changes
     → invoke `/review-resolver $PR_NUMBER`. That skill is responsible for listing each actionable point, proposing a fix, and prompting for execution.
   - Failing required status checks → invoke `/review-resolver $PR_NUMBER` as well so the failure surfaces alongside human review comments.
   - No actionable items and checks green → output `PR <PR_NUMBER> is clear after the 10-minute review window.` and end the maverick run.

4. **Loop guard**: do not re-schedule Phase 7 from inside itself. After one resolver hand-off the user drives the next iteration. Maverick's job ends when the 10-min window has been honored once.

---

## Completion

Emit completion **only after Phase 7's review window has been honored** (one scheduled check, then either a `/review-resolver` hand-off or a "clear" result).

### Single Ticket (Linear)
```
MAVERICK_COMPLETE

Branch: feature/<ticket>
Summary: <bullets>
PR: <PR_URL>
Review: <"clear after 10-min window" | "handed off to /review-resolver">
```

### Multiple Tickets (Linear)
```
MAVERICK_PARALLEL_COMPLETE

Completed Tickets:
- AP-552: feature/ap-552 | PR #<n> | <review status>
- AP-553: feature/ap-553 | PR #<n> | <review status>
- AP-554: feature/ap-554 | PR #<n> | <review status>
```

### Local Task
```
MAVERICK_COMPLETE

## Approval & Progress Reports

### Single Approval
- **ONE checkpoint only**: After senior-architect presents the plan
- After approval: **FULLY AUTONOMOUS** - no more questions

### Progress Report Schedule
| Elapsed | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| 0-5 min | Silent |
| 5-20 min | Every 2 min |
| 20-30 min | Every 5 min |
| 30+ min | Every 15 min |

### Report Format
```
[HH:MM] Phase: X | Working on: <current task>
```

---

## Rules

1. **ONE approval only** - after architect, then autonomous
2. **No interruptions** - never ask questions after approval
3. **Progress reports** - follow the time schedule
4. QA must pass before commit
5. No Co-Authored-By
6. Summary in English
7. Worktrees are isolated - no conflicts
8. Each ticket/task = independent branch
9. Make decisions autonomously - document, don't ask
10. **Local mode**: no Linear calls, derive everything from description + codebase
